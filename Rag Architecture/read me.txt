# RAG Chatbot

## Description
This project contains a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot** implemented in Jupyter Notebook. The chatbot integrates retrieval-based tools and generative models to provide intelligent responses based on retrieved knowledge. The flow of the chatbot process is visually described in the workflow diagram included.

The core steps include:
1. **Retrieve**: Fetch relevant information using retrieval tools.
2. **Rewrite**: Optionally refine or preprocess the retrieved data.
3. **Generate**: Produce a final response using a language generation model.

The process is orchestrated through an agent-based design.

## File Overview
- **Rag Chatbot.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation and workflow of the RAG chatbot.
- **Workflow Diagram (image.png)**: A visual representation of the chatbot's process, showing the agent performing retrieval, rewrite, and generation tasks.

## Requirements
Ensure the following dependencies are installed to run the notebook:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `transformers`
  - `langchain`
  - `openai`
  - `torch`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib` (if needed for visuals)

Install dependencies using pip:

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Rag\ Chatbot.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to execute the chatbot process.

## Workflow Diagram
The workflow begins with the **agent**, which uses tools to **retrieve** knowledge, optionally **rewrite** it, and finally **generate** the output. Here's the visual representation:
